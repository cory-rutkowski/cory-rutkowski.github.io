[Analysis and Visualization of NFL Draft Prospects](/project1_page.md)
<br>

<br>
<br>
Using SQL and supervised learning models I predicted and visualized the NFL draft process for collegiate football players. I created a multi-class classification neural network model to determine what position (round) each player might get drafted into.
Used a combination of my own created PostgreSQL database and Tableau to visualize the different data relationships.
I feel that this model could be beneficial in the future for collegiate athletes to try to determine if their current body of work is enough for them to continue their dream of playing in the NFL, or if they should continue to try to improve their skills/stats/awards to try to better improve their draft chances.

There are several areas that I want to improve on and will continue working on in the future:
- Getting more Up-to-Date Data
- Creating Additional Metrics to Use in Model
- Continue Analysis by Position Breakdown
- Increase Model Performance
- More Advance Visualizations
